Weather Web Application in JAVA usiing VAADIN & SpringBoot
You have to use your own API Key and insert it inside the APIkey String in WeahterServices Class.
I have added a OKHttp Dependency in hte Pom.xml file if you are making a new project you have to add that dependency.
I have used comments in the code for you to understand the code better
If there is a problem in understndion the code you can watch my video tutorial on Youtube
last but not the least fork this repo and make you changes in the code. 
give me star if it was helpful
